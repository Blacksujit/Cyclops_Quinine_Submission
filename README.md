## Step-by-Step Guide to Using Cyclops for ML Deployments

### Setting Up Your Environment

Before you start, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- A Kubernetes cluster
- Cyclops installed on your cluster
- Docker installed on your local machine
- Your ML model ready for deployment

### Containerizing Your ML Model

First, you need to containerize your ML model using Docker. Here's an example Dockerfile for a simple ML model:

```dockerfile
# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.8-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY . /app

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Make port 80 available to the world outside this container
EXPOSE 80

# Define environment variable
ENV NAME World

# Run app.py when the container launches
CMD ["python", "app.py"]

```


```
   docker build -t my-ml-model .
```


### Creating a Kubernetes Deployment:


```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: ml-model-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: ml-model
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: ml-model
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: ml-model
        image: my-ml-model:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

### Apply the deployment:

```
kubectl apply -f ml-model-deployment.yaml

```

### Exposing Your Deployment:


```

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: ml-model-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: ml-model
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
  type: LoadBalancer

```

### Apply the service:

```
kubectl apply -f ml-model-service.yaml

```


### Monitoring and Managing with Cyclops:


Cyclops provides powerful monitoring tools to keep track of your ML deployments. Use Cyclops' dashboard to monitor the performance and health of your deployments. Set up alerts to notify you of any issues, ensuring your ML models run smoothly.


### Conclusion:

Cyclops is a game-changer for ML deployments on Kubernetes. By simplifying the deployment process, providing robust monitoring tools, and seamlessly integrating with Kubernetes, Cyclops makes it easier to manage and scale your ML models.
